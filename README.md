Hi everyone!

This repo contains the articles/books I have read.
Articles/Books can be related to [Go](#go), [Python](#python-and-django), [Django](#python-and-django) and [DevOps](#python-and-django) in general.

I want to add articles/books that I think are necessary.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to add the articles/books I have read in the past, 
but you can be sure that I will add the articles I will read hereinafter.

Most of the books I read are from [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/).
